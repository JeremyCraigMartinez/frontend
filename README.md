##Frontend Server

> This is the frontend server to the WSU & UI NSF funded research project. This web app is written using the [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) framework. Most (if not all) of the styling will by done using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/). The package manager I will be using is called [Bower](http://bower.io/). And finally, I will be using a "task runner" called [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
